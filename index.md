For 1.16.5 Magma Server Download, go to this link [Click Me](https://github.com/magmafoundation/Magma-1.16.x/releases/tag/v75c9e73)
Once you're at the new link, download both the "magma-1.16.5-36.2.9-75c9e73-STABLE-installer.jar" and the "magma-1.16.5-36.2.9-75c9e73-STABLE-launcher.jar" jar files.
Place the installer file on your desktop and create a new folder named whatever you want. Open the installer jar file and chose "Install server", point the directory at the new folder you created on your desktop. Wait a couple seconds, or minutes depending on how fast your internet is. Once the file is done, you should see a few jar files and a folder named "libraries". Put all those files into your File Manager and place the "magma-1.16.5-36.2.9-75c9e73-STABLE-launcher.jar" into your File Manager as well, and rename "magma-1.16.5-36.2.9-75c9e73-STABLE-launcher.jar" to "server.jar" and run your server. It should all start up and your server is now Magma 1.16.5
